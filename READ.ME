# Task_1 Terraform Exercise

## Today’s Exercise
A VPC is created with **public and private subnets**, and **EC2 instances** are launched inside the VPC.
- EC2 instances in the **public subnet have internet access**.
- EC2 instances in the **private subnet do not have any internet access**.

## Task Overview
The goal of this exercise is to design a basic AWS network using Terraform, including a VPC, subnets, routing, and EC2 instances.

## Key Points
- **Public Subnet**
  - Hosts EC2 instances with internet access through an Internet Gateway.
- **Private Subnet**
  - Hosts EC2 instances without internet access.
- **Routing and Security**
  - Public subnet routes traffic to the Internet Gateway.
  - Private subnet routes traffic only within the VPC.
  - Security Groups control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

## Goal
- Demonstrate AWS **network segmentation**.
- Understand the difference between **public and private subnets**.
- Control internet access using route tables and gateways.

## Result
- Public subnet EC2 instances can access the internet.
- Private subnet EC2 instances are isolated from the internet.
- VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and EC2 instances are created and associated correctly using Terraform.
